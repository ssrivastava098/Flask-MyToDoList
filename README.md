This is a basic ToDo Application that I have created using Flask. This was done as a part of my Flask learning journey with CodeWithHarry(Youtuber).
I have used SQLlite as a database here.

In order to run the application follow these steps.

Clone this repository and save it as a seperate folder in your project.
Open it in any editor of your choice. (preferable VS Code)
It is good practice to create a virtual environment in python and make any install any requirements in a virtual environment.
Step 1: pip install virtualenv

Step 2: virtualenv yourenvironmentname

If error is coming up then set you execution policy to unrestricted by opening powershell in administrative mode.

Command :- Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

Step 3:- Download all the files mentioned in requirement.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4:- python app.py
The application will open up in a web browser.
